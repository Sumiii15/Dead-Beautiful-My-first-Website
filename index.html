    <h1>Dead Beautiful</h1>
    <!-- <h2>Dead Beautiful</h2>
    <h3>Dead Beautiful</h3> -->
    <p>And when one of them meets with his other half...the pair are lost in an
        amazement of love and friendship and intimacy, and one will not be out of the
        other’s sight...even for a moment:<br> these are the people who pass their whole lives
        together, and yet they could not explain what they desire of one another. For the
        intense yearning which each of them has toward the other does not appear to be
        the desire of lover’s intercourse, but of something else which the soul of either
        evidently desires and cannot tell, and of which she has only a dark and doubtful
        presentiment.</p>

            <li>I DIDN’T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT DEATH UNTIL I began studying
                philosophy</li>
            <li>That was how I learned the truth about Descartes, about the ancient
                Greek and Roman civilizations, about my past.</li>
            <li>My mother used to tell me that matter was neither created nor destroyed, only transferred.</li>
